In the United States, journalism is supposed to be independent and unbiased. However, most news sources have either liberal or conservative biases that affect the way they present the news. While it is an over-generalization to determine bias based on word choice, it would be interesting to look at the number of times certain key words are used on different news sites and see if these usage statistics correlate with perceived bias. 

(A link to an article discussing this issue: http://www.aim.org/on-target-blog/media-bias-in-strategic-word-choice/)

For my final project, I'd like to analyze the language used to describe events on right- and left-leaning news sources. To do this, I will download archives of articles from Fox News and MSNBC, two sources that sit at either end of the political spectrum. From there, I will write a script to perform word searches on each archive in order to compare the issues they focus on. 

As for the deliverable for this final project, I will be turning in a Fox News scraper script, an MSNBC scraper script, and a general word counter that parses the raw html. But I don't want to stop there -- I'd like to think critically about what I find, and if it's significant or interesting at all, I'd like to write a story for Peninsula Press. 

I'm interested in who uses the following words more:

1) terrorist
2) gangster
3) drug
4) Republican
5) Democrat
6) deadlock
7) bipartisan
8) middle class
9) deficit
10)poor/poverty
11)security
12)liberty
13)equality

More words to come: this is a preliminary list. I want to think more about words that imply a certain emphasis, as well as similar words with slightly different connotations to see if word usage is connected to bias. This article (http://freakonomics.com/2012/02/16/how-biased-is-your-media/) has a list of common words used by Republicans and Democrats in Congress which I will use as a jumping off point.

I think this project will help me in my awareness of bias in my personal word choices as well as make me a more critical and thoughtful consumer of the news.
