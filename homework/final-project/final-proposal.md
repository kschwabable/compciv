From my draft proposal, I've decided to use hashtags on Twitter as the jumping off point for counting words. 

The general idea:

To collect all the tweets that have a certain hashtag, such as #blacklivesmatter, that still exist in the twitter API. 

To analyze this body of text based on:
 - users tweeting about this topic --> with futher analysis of users' bios to search for key words like "journalist," "writer," "politician," etc.
 - word frequency --> to think about the types of language used to describe certain issues
- days during which the hashtag was used the most (using time stamps) - to see how hashtag usage changes over time depending on the news cycle. 

Ideally my program would take a hashtag as input, and then spit out these counts visually, on a webpage. 

Once I have that program, I want to do some more specific projects, like looking at top words used by activists tweeting, by conservatives tweeting, by liberals tweeting, by journalists tweeting.
